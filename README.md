# Table and Friends iOS Application

## About

My first native iOS app. My inspiration was "tableandfriends.com" a social dinning app, with two main objectives: Either joining/creating public themed meals or creating private meals which can be attended exclusively upon invitation. 

## Dev. stuff

- Xcode 4.6
- iOS 6.1 (using ARC, GCD and storyboard)
- Facebook SDK (for testing purpose its necessary a facebook key)
