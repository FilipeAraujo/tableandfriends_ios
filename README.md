tableandfriends_ios
===================

My first native iOS app. My inspiration was "tableandfriends.com" a social dinning app, with two main objectives: Either joining/creating public themed meals or creating private meals which can be attended exclusively upon invitation. 

Dev stuff
===================

- xcode 4.6
- iOS 6.1 (using ARC, GCD and storyboard)
- facebook SDK (for testing purpose its necessary a facebook key)
